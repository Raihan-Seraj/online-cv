      Selected interesting projects that I have done during my graduate studies at McGill University.
    assignments:
      - title: Learning in games.
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Studied different learning frameworks in stochastic games since learning in game theoretic framework is interesting as it does not necessarily guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium or any concepts of equilibria in general. The project focused on analyzing one of the simplest and earliest form of learning algorithm known as the fictitious play"

      - title: Soft Trust DDPG
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Devised a trust region interpretation for Deep Deterministic Policy gradient algorithms. The proposed architecture allowed the use of regularization for  deterministic policies in different continuous control tasks."

      - title: Reinforcement Learning in Multi-agent Swarms
        link: "#"
        tagline: "An adapted version of conventional single agent RL algorithm was applied for swarm robotics in the context of swarms adapting to different target distribution, the work was further extended to incorporate hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture."

      - title: ICLR Reproducibility Challenge. 
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Analyzed the reproducibility of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for ICLR 2017 Reproducibility challenge."

      - title: Unifying On-Policy and Off-Policy Learning in TD Learning and Actor Critic Methods
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Combined the stability of On-Policy TD learning with the efficiency of Off-Policy Learning and proposed a unified approach where the control algorithm either uses on-policy sampled action or off-policy samples depending on the amount of exploration. The idea has been further extended to Actor Critic methods and Q(sigma) algorithm with eligibility traces."
